### Database Schema

times when we discovered features would be easier to implement with changes to 
our database schema.

## Future Improvements

___

This project was a sprint. Some features we would like to include in the future
are:

  - Searching across more tags than just titles including publishers and genres.
  - Updating the database to include genres of comics to allow more refined
  browsing.
  - Updating the database to include a table of collection names to simplify 
  queries and make code easier to read.
  - Generating comic book recommendations for users based on past searches and
  selections.
